| Cool shows I have been to |
+===========================+

Thu 03/22/12 - Justice, The Tabernacle

This was like the first actual concert I ever went to. It was cool. The
Tabernacle is a super dope venue and I'd love to go back for another show
sometime. I wish NYC had venues like that - Terminal 5 is sorta close, but
their balcony isn't nearly as awesome.

(update: after I originally wrote this entry, I went to my first show at
Webster Hall, which is similarly pretty, but not nearly as awesome in general)


Sat 02/16/13 - Indiecade East: Night Games, Museum of the Moving Image

This was like the second week I was in NYC, and it was a fun little
adventure. I remember having trouble just getting up to Astoria, with some
part of the G being closed, and a very confused shuttle bus driver not
knowing the difference between Queens Plaza and Queensboro Plaza.

I met Brendon Cheung of Blendo Games fame! He was awesome. I got to play
BariBariBall and a few other interesting multiplayer games, like a weird
5-player lunar lander game. Also got to try an Oculus Rift for the first
time. Oh, and I got to play Renga, which is a super cool game that can
only be played in a massive crowd, where everyone gets a laser pointer and
points it at a screen to move a spaceship around and upgrade it and shoot
things.


Wed 03/06/13 - Andrew WK, 285 Kent

This was my first concert in NYC, and it was ridiculous and awesome. There
were like three openers, and by the time Andrew came out on stage, he was
plastered. He ended up playing an hour set of him banging on a keyboard
while going in and out of "Party Hard." Totally awesome. I went with
several cool people from Hacker School, some of whom I still hang out with
today!


Wed 03/20/13 - The Protomen/You Bred Raptors, Santos Party House

I almost forgot I saw this show! It was cool. I hadn't really listened to their
second album much by the time I saw this show, but walked away liking it a lot
more than I did the first time I listened to it. Also, Bohemean Rhapsody was
cool.

YBR was a cool surprise; I still listen to their album on Spotify occasionally.


Fri 05/17/13 - Anamanaguchi/Pictureplane/Hot Sugar, Irving Plaza

I don't remember a lot about this show. I went because some Hacker School
friends were going, but I'm not really a huge Anamanagchi fan - I like the
whole chiptune thing, but they just don't do it for me. However, I do remember
liking their show a lot because it just became a whirring blur of poppy synths
at some point, and that was very easy to dance to. I also remember one of the
openers having some of the weirdest projected visuals ever, freaky GIFs and
strange YouTubes. Interesting night.


Sat 06/29/13 - 4Knots Music Festival, South St Seaport
               Kurt Vile & the Violators
               The Men
               Parquet Courts
               White Lung

This was a weird outdoor festival at a seaport. I spent the better part of
a day there, since White Lung went on at 3 and The Men went on at 7, and
those were the two bands I was mostly interested in seeing. My roommate at
the time showed up, and I randomly ran into my friend from Hacker School,
so it was a good time.

White Lung was awesome to see, but the crowd was totally dead, since no
one wants to mosh in 90 degree weather at 3 in the afternoon. Still, I was
excited just to get to say I'd seen them live, since they were only
playing in 21-and-over venues and I was still underage.

I don't really remember the rest of the sets too much. I remember being
kind of bored with Kurt Vile, and while I liked The Men's big singles,
I wasn't impressed with their quieter stuff. I still sort of feel that
way, though if it catches me in the right mood, I can really appreciate
their ballads.


Tue 08/06/13 - Disclosure/TNGHT/Julio Bashmore, Central Park SummerStage

WOOOOOW what a show this was. I think the bill mostly speaks for itself;
I'm not sure I'll ever see a better lineup in one night. The place went
insane when TNGHT dropped Blood on the Leaves, as it had *just* come out.

Disclosure was great, and had both Sam Smith (pre-fame) and Jesse Ware.
I ended up hanging out with a group of very high dudes for a while, and
harmonized on Latch at the end of the show with them :3

Thu 01/08/15 - TNA Impact Wrestling taping, Manhattan Center (Hammerstein Ballroom)

Yeah, so, wrestling! It was $20. Don't hate. We all have our stupid
hobbies.

The most ridiculous part of this - and there were many ridiculous parts,
because *wrestling* - was that when I took my initial seat, I posted
a picture of it on a forum saying that it was what was available for $20.
Turns out, there was a guy sitting behind me who also posted on this
forum, and saw my post, and so we ended up hanging out for the whole show!
He knew a lot more about the TNA roster than I did, so that worked out
well for me. We also ended up getting moved to really good seats that were
probably $50-60 online. Thank god TNA is such an unpopular promotion.

I legitimately enjoyed this. Like, I unironically love wrestling, the big
dumb spectacle it is, but TNA is *bad* wrestling, at least on TV. In
person, though, it's a lot easier to just laugh at the bad booking (aka
"writing") and appreciate the in-ring action. There were lots of
impressive performances by wrestlers I hadn't seen before (Low Ki, Kurt
Angle, the Hardys), and I ended up marking out for things that I would
probably make fun of if I saw them on TV.


Fri 01/09/15 - Patton Oswalt, Carnegie Hall

Patton! Wow. Probably the first comedian I ever really loved. I've
listened to his specials so many times that I know a lot of his bits by
heart. I actually got a *front row seat*, too, thanks to catching the
Twitter presale right on time.

This was a great show, a mix of stuff from his last special (which I think
worked a lot better here, with a little more practice) and a lot of new
jokes. In the encore, he ended up taking requests, and ended up doing some
of my favorite bits. I also got to stand up and shake the dude's hand at
the end, which was awesome.

Also, Carnegie Hall is beautiful and I should try to go to more shows
there.


Thu 01/29/15 (7pm) - Viet Cong, Mercury Lounge

I was happy to finally see these guys play, having listened to their
singles on repeat for the last two months. When their album dropped,
I wasn't that impressed with it, but having heard it live, I actually
liked it a lot more. It's interesting how the more raw rock/pop aspects of
their music come into play when they're not hiding it behind the
traditional post-rock lo-fi studio mixing. Really excited to see them
again next time they're here.


Thu 01/29/15 (12am) - Savages, Baby's All Right

This was such a weird, incredible show, and maybe the best I've ever been
to. It was weird, given that Savages went on at *1:15am* on a weeknight,
as their show getting rescheduled due to a blizzard. It was even weirder
for me because I was just regaining my hearing from seeing Viet Cong
earlier, and now I was standing front-and-center for one of my favorite
current bands.

I was in the literal front row of a GA audience for, I think, the first
time ever, and it made Savages seem ever-so-larger-than-life. Staring
straight up into their frontwoman's face as she screamed over my head is
an experience I'll never forget. I get goosebumps thinking about it now.


Sun 02/22/15 - Kyle Kinane, Bowery Ballroom

Great set. All new material, which surprised me, given his new special was only
a month ago - can't imagine writing a whole new hour in that time. He was still
workshopping some of it, and very self-depricating about it (apologizing for a
hilarious never-ending bit on reality show ghosts).


Tue 02/24/15 - Screaming Females, Rough Trade NYC

*Loud.* I heard about this band last week, and picked up their record this
morning to get entry to this show. They played their new record in its
entirety, and it was awesome. Somewhat low-key crowd, being an early show on a
weeknight, but the band was as loud as I could stand in such a small room. Also
bought a T-shirt from their bass player after the show.
